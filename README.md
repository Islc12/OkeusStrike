## History

Okeus was a god of the Powhatan tribe located in Central/Eastern Virginia, USA. He's associated as the God of war and often considered
vengeful or wrathful. Mistakenly considered the devil by early Europeaon colonists as well as missionaries who had misinterpreted the
Powhatan Okeus was actually likely to be the most important God in their pantheon. Okeus was also believed to be able to bring misfortunes
such as illness, crop failure, and other disasters to the Powhatan if not gratified. Due to this belief, Okeus was often worshiped
extensively by the Powhatan and their spiritual leaders attmpted to commune with Okeaus to bring good fortune.
