NAME
    OkeusStrike - Advanced Deauthentication Attack Tool

SYNOPSIS
    okeus [OPTIONS] -i [INTERFACE]

DESCRIPTION
    OkeusStrike is a powerful and versatile tool for performing deauthentication attacks, and in some cases DoS attacks, on wireless networks. It was 
    designed to be highly customizable and has a wide range of features to suit different attack scenarios. OkeusStrike was designed with scripting in
    mind and can be integrated into other scripts and tools. Certain "luxury" features found in other WiFi attack tools are not included  in OkeusStrike,
    and instead are left to the user to implement using other tools or designing a custom tool themselves. OkeusStrike was written with the intent of
    being used for Penetration Testing, Ethical Hacking, Red Team assessments, or other Network Security Audits. It is not intended for malicious purposes. 

USAGE
    To use OkeusStrke, you must first enable monitor mode on your wireless interface. This can be done using the ip command suite or whatever external tool
    you prefer. OkeusStrike will not work without monitor mode enabled. In addition, OkeusStrike must be run as root. 

OPTIONS
    -h, --help 
        Prints the help menu

    -v, --verbose
        Enables verbose output

    -i <interface>, --interface <interface>
        Specifies the wireless interface to use, e.g. wlan1. This option is required for all operations excluding the help option.

    -d <dest_mac>, --dest <dest_mac>
        Specifies the client MAC address to target.

    -s <source_mac>, --source <source_mac>
        Specifies the source AP MAC address to use. If not specified, the source MAC will default to the Network BSSID of the target network.

    -n <network_bssid>, --network <network_bssid>  
        Specifies the network BSSID to associate with the deauthentication attack.

    -b, --broadcast
       Specifies that the deauthentication attack should be broadcasted to all clients on the target network.

    --delay <time_in_ms>
        Specifies a time delay in milliseconds to wait between sending deauthentication packets. This option can be useful for slowing down the rate of
        deauthentication frames being sent to the target.

    --run-time <time_in_s>

    --flood
        Sends out a large number of deauthentication packets to the target, flooding them with deauthentication frames for a user specified duration of time.
        By inputing "-1" the user can flood frames indefintely until ctrl + c is used. This option cannot be used with --count or --time.

    --count <num_frames>
        Specifies a number specific number of deauthentication frames to send the target. The default is 5 deauthentication frames. This option cannot be used
        with --flood.

    --duration <[1-65535]>
        Specifies the time in microseconds for the destination to wait before accessing the medium after receiving the frame.

    --fragment <[1-15]>
        Specifies that the deauthentication frames should be fragmented and will be fragmented based on a user supplied size in bytes.

    --random-frag
        Automatically randomizes the fragmentation bits.

    --sequence <[1-4095]>
       Specifies the total number of fragmented frames to send from user input.

    --auto-seq
        Automatically increments the sequence number.

    --reason-code <[1-66]>
        Specifies the reason code to use for the deauthentication frame, choices range from 1 to 66.

    --dry-run
        Conducts a dry run of the program, producing all output without actually sending any frames.
