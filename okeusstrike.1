NAME
    OkeusStrike - Advanced Deauthentication Attack Tool

SYNOPSIS
    okeus [OPTIONS] -i [INTERFACE]

DESCRIPTION
    OkeusStrike is a powerful and versatile tool for performing deauthentication attacks, and in some cases DoS attacks, on wireless networks. It was 
    designed to be highly customizable and has a wide range of features to suit different attack scenarios. OkeusStrike was designed with scripting in
    mind and can be integrated into other scripts and tools. Certain "luxury" features found in other WiFi attack tools are not included  in OkeusStrike,
    and instead are left to the user to implement using other tools or designing a custom tool themselves. OkeusStrike was written with the intent of
    being used for Penetration Testing, Ethical Hacking, and Red Team assessments. It is not intended for malicious purposes. 

USAGE
    To use OkeusStrke, you must first enable monitor mode on your wireless interface. This can be done using the ip command suite or whatever external tool
    you prefer. OkeusStrike will not work without monitor mode enabled. In addition, OkeusStrike must be run as root. 

OPTIONS
    -h, --help 
        Prints the help menu

    -v, --verbose
        Enables verbose output

    -i <interface>, --interface <interface>
        Specifies the wireless interface to use, e.g. wlan1. This option is required for all operations excluding the help option.

    -c <client_mac>, --client <client_mac>
        Specifies the client MAC address to target.

    -s <source_mac>, --source <source_mac>
        Specifies the source AP MAC address to use. If not specified, the source MAC will default to the Network BSSID of the target network.

    -n <network_bssid>, --network <network_bssid>  
        Specifies the network BSSID to associate with the deauthentication attack.

    -b, --broadcast
       Specifies that the deauthentication attack should be broadcasted to all clients on the target network.

    --time <time_in_ms>
        Specifies a time delay in milliseconds to wait between sending deauthentication packets. This option can be useful for slowing down the rate of
        deauthentication frames being sent to the target. 

    --flood <time_in_sec>
        Sends out a large number of deauthentication packets to the target, flooding them with deauthentication frames for a user specified duration of time.
        The default time for the flood attack is 5 seconds long. This option cannot be used with --count or --time.

    --count <num_frames>
        Specifies a number specific number of deauthentication frames to send the target. The default is 5 deauthentication frames. This option cannot be used
        with --flood.

    --fragment <bytes>
        Specifies that the deauthentication frames should be fragmented and will be fragmented based on a user supplied size in bytes. This option will automatically
        add padding for fragment sizes that are odd in number to the frame size or are larger than the frame size. 
            Example: if the frame size is 50 bytes, the user inputs 26 bytes for the fragment size, OkeusStrike will send (2) 26 byte fragmented frames, with each frame
            having an extra byte of padding to make up for the odd numbered total. 
        
        This is also true for input fragment sizes larger than the frame size, in which case the frame will be padded and fragmented based on the specified
        fragment size. 
            Example: if the frame size is 50 bytes, the user inputs 60 bytes for the fragment size, OkeusStrike will send (2) 60 byte fragmented frames, with each
            frame having 25 bytes of the original frame and 35 bytes of padding. 
        
        For fragment sizes are a less than half the size of the original frame size, the frame will be
        divided into fragments of the specified size and sent in as many fragments as needed to send the entire frame with padding for equal sized fragments.
            Example: if the frame size is 50 bytes, the user inputs 24 bytes for the fragment size, OkeusStrike will send (2) 24 byte fragmented frames, followed by (1) 
            2 byte fragmented frame, for a total of (3) fragmented frames.

        This option can be combined with --sequence (described below) for increased control over the fragmentation of the deauthentication frame.

    --sequence <sequence_number>
       Specifies the total number of fragmented frames to send from user input. The option will automatically provide padding for odd numbered totals.

            Example: if the frame size is 50 bytes, the user inputs (4) for the sequence number, OkeusStrike will send (4) frames of 13 bytes each, with each frame sending
            a portion of the origial frame and padded to account for the odd numbered total.

        If the user inputs a sequence number greater than the size of the frame, then OkeusStrike will send as many fragmented frames as possible with the original frame
        data and then send the remaining frames with padding to make up the total number of frames specified.
            Example: if the frame size is 50 bytes, the user inputs (60) for the sequence number, OkeusStrike will send the first 50 frames with 1 byte each of the original
            data, and the remaining 10 frames will be sent with 1 byte of padding each.

        This option can be combined with --fragment (described above) for increased control over the fragmentation of the deauthentication frame.

    --reason-code <[1-14]>
        Specifies the reason code to use for the deauthentication frame, choices range from 1 to 14 inclusive. The default reason code is 3.

    --duration <duration_in_ms>
        Specifies the duration of the deauthentication attack in milliseconds. OkeusStrike will automatically send (1) deauthentication frame every 25 milliseconds. 
        This can be adjusted with the --time option to increase or slow down the rate of deauthentication frames being sent.
